# Quick note on naming conventions: when I was first learning Python, my teacher was an old dude who had been doing code since
# it was first around, and he taught us that using camelCase was the correct way to name variables and functions. I looked it
# up, and apparently that was the old standard before they switched it to snake_case. Sorry if it takes me a bit to get used
# to doing it the other way. I'm not great at breaking habits.
